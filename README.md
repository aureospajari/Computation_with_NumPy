# Computation_with_NumPy
Computation with NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays

In this lesson we looked at how to:

<ul>
  <li>Create arrays manually with np.array()</li>
  <li>Generate arrays using  .arange(), .random(), and .linspace()</li>
  <li>Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray</li>
  <li>Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices</li>
  <li>Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication</li>
  <li>Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible</li>
  <li>Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays</li>
</ul>

What a mathematical lesson!
